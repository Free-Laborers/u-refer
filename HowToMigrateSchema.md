1. Just try to run the "run.sh" or "run.bat" file. If it does migrate, good for you! You are done and don't need to do anyting <br/>

If it is not working, then proceed to step2. It will be somewhat long process, but once you have done this, then you will not need to reset your schema any longer, so you don't need to do this again in the future!

2. There could be a case (this is not an error) that your console has the following statements and does not update anything:
```
? - Drift detected: Your database schema is not in sync with your migration history.

<br/>

This is because you need to reset ur database. When you reset the database with Prisma, it asks again for the confirmation of the reset. However, your current console is not interactive, and there is no way that you can say "yes!" for the confirmation. The solution is to use the interactive console. 

3. Open another terminal. Run: ```docker exec -it urefer-backend bash ```. This means now you are using the console for the container.
4. Run: ```npx prisma migrate dev --name init```
5. It will ask the same huge things, but this time, you will be able to say "Yes" by typing "y".

```
We need to reset the PostgreSQL database "urefer" at "172.19.0.2:5432".
Do you want to continue? All data will be lost. â€º (y/N)
```

6. Say "yes", and then your database will be updated.
7. Open another terminal. Go to the root folder. Run: ```docker cp urefer-backend:/app/prisma/migrations ./backend/prisma```

Finally, It is done.
